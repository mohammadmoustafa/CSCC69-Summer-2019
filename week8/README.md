# Week 8 & 9 - EXT2 File System

For this week 8 and 9 we'll be talking about the EXT2 file system and how it works. The goal is to prepare you for your third assignment.

Instructions can be found in w10.html. I'd recommend you clone/fork this repo and work from there.

*Note:* For week 8 we'll only be going as far as task 1
