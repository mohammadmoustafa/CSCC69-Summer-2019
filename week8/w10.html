  <h1>Tutorial Exercise  - Ext2 file system structure </h1>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For Assignment 3, you will be manipulating an Ext2 file system image. 
The next few exercises are intended to help you get started on the assignment 
by helping you understand the structure of the file system.
Please start early to fully take advantage of the tutorial time to ask questions.
</p>

<!--p>
There will be no lecture exercise this week, to give you more time to work 
on the two tutorial exercises for this week, in order to get a headstart early 
on A3. 
</p-->

<!--p>You may work in pairs for this exercise. MarkUs will only create the 
appropriate directory in your repository when you log into MarkUs and 
either create your group, or declare that you will work alone.  
The groups will get a new shared repository, and the students working 
solo may also get a new repository.  
Please log into MarkUs well before the deadline to take these steps.  
(If you create the directory manually in svn, then MarkUs won't know 
about it and we won't be able to see your work.)
</p-->

<!--p>It is your responsibility to log into MarkUs <em>before</em> the 
exercise deadline to ensure that you know where to commit your work, 
and so that MarkUs can connect your work to the grading system.
</p-->

<!--p>If you work with different partners for this exercise and later for A3, 
then please make a note in a README file in A3 saying who you worked with 
on the exercises in case the code for some parts looks too similar.</p-->

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<p>Please read the Assignment 3 handout.  It has links to some resources 
that you will need to read to fully understand the ext2 structure,
especially sections "Learning about the Filesystem" and "Mounting a filesystem".</p>

<p>You are given two files as starter code:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="./ext2.h">ext2.h</a></li>
    <li><a href="./readimage.c">readimage.c</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also a bunch of disk images available to you:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="./images/emptydisk.img">emptydisk</a>: An empty virtual disk.</li>
    <li><a href="./images/onefile.img">onefile</a>: A single text file has been added to emptydisk.</li>
    <li><a href="./images/deletedfile.img">deletedfile</a>: The file from onefile has been removed.</li>
    <li><a href="./images/onedirectory.img">onedirectory</a>: A single directory containing a text file has been added to emptydisk.</li>
    <li><a href="./images/hardlink.img">hardlink</a>: A hard link to the textfile in onedirectory was added.</li>
    <li><a href="./images/deleteddirectory.img">deleteddirectory</a>: A recursive remove was used to remove the directory and file from onedirectory.</li>
    <li><a href="./images/twolevel.img">twolevel</a>: The root directory contains a directory called <code>level1</code> and a file called <code>afile</code>. <code>level1</code> contains a directory called <code>level2</code>, and <code>level2</code> contains a file called <code>bfile</code>.</li>
    <li><a href="./images/largefile.img">largefile</a>: A file larger than 13KB (13440 bytes) is in the root directory.  This file requires the single indirect block in the inode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <code>readimage</code> uses <code>mmap</code> to map 
the disk image file into memory.  The superblock is in the second 
block on the disk starting at byte 1024, so we can interpret these 
bytes as the super block struct.</p>

<p>You should also look at these bytes of the one of the images, 
for example emptydisk.img by running <code>xxd emptydisk.img > emptydisk.txt</code>
and using an editor to view the contents of the file. Try the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Figure out where each block starts.</li>
    <li>See what the inode bit map and block bitmaps look like.</li>
    <li>Find other non-empty blocks to see if you can see what might be in them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your task for this exercise is simple.  Add to <code>readimage</code> 
to print out the following fields from the block group descriptor.  
For <code>emptydisk.img</code> your output should look <em>exactly</em> 
like the following. In other words, we should be able to use <code>diff</code> 
to compare your output to this and see that it is identical.</p>
<pre>
Inodes: 32
Blocks: 128
Block group:
    block bitmap: 3
    inode bitmap: 4
    inode table: 5
    free blocks: 105
    free inodes: 21
    used_dirs: 2
</pre>


<h2>Task2</h2>

<p>Using the same code you wrote, add the code to print out
the inode and block bitmaps, and the inodes. </p>

<p>For <code>emptydisk.img</code> your output should <em>exactly</em>
match the following. In other words, we should be able to use
<code>diff</code> to compare your output to this and see that
it is identical.</p>
<pre>
Inodes: 32
Blocks: 128
Block group:
    block bitmap: 3
    inode bitmap: 4
    inode table: 5
    free blocks: 105
    free inodes: 21
    used_dirs: 2
Block bitmap: 11111111 11111111 11111100 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
Inode bitmap: 11111111 11100000 00000000 00000000

Inodes:
[2] type: d size: 1024 links: 3 blocks: 2
[2] Blocks:  9
</pre>

<p>For <code>onefile.img</code> your output should match the following:</p>
<pre>
Inodes: 32
Blocks: 128
Block group:
    block bitmap: 3
    inode bitmap: 4
    inode table: 5
    free blocks: 104
    free inodes: 20
    used_dirs: 2
Block bitmap: 11111111 11111111 11111100 00000000 00100000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
Inode bitmap: 11111111 11110000 00000000 00000000

Inodes:
[2] type: d size: 1024 links: 3 blocks: 2
[2] Blocks:  9
[12] type: f size: 128 links: 1 blocks: 2
[12] Blocks:  35
</pre>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p>Your final task in this series of exercises is to print the directory
block contents. While you are doing this, you should work out how the
directory structure creates a linked list of directory entries by using
<code>rec_len</code> to show where the next directory entry begins.
Note that <code>rec_len</code> in the last directory entry takes you
to the end of the block.</p>

<p>For <code>emptydisk.img</code> your output should <em>exactly</em>
match the following. In other words, we should be able to use <code>diff</code>
to compare your output to this and see that it is identical.</p>
